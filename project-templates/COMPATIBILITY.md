# COMPATIBILITY
This is a manifest of every unique file represented in `project-templates`, along with the source I referenced to create and document it, and the most recent validation time/date (the last point in time that I manually verified everything against the current authority: accuracy, validity, compatibility, usage, support, version, etc.). This allows anyone to see how out of date a template or file might be, compared to the official information regarding it.

**TODO: consider also including version**
