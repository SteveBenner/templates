# Project templates

These directories act as 'starter templates' for various types of software projects.

Each represents a collection of commonly-used and/or important files which may be copied *as-is* into a new project and edited for personal use. These are not *templates* themselves, but rather *EXAMPLE* documents that offer pre-defined structure and defaults based on real-world standards and practices.

The files serve two purposes: first and foremost, they act as **'cookie cutter' assets** that can be used within a project **as-is** (with or without being edited), speeding up project development, and establishing consistent defaults and documentation based on current official specs and usage.

Primarily, however, a files serve as a **guide** for the user, providing thorough documentation and explanation of a file's content, content order, structure, usage, importance, and more. Any required or typical defaults or values are mentioned and discussed, as well as examples, ideas, and suggestions for a user when customizing or adding their own content. A user should have everything they need to understand and successfully integrate any of these files within a modern project, based on the guide.

#### There are two kinds of template directories:
- The majority are intended for ***a specific type of project***, such a Ruby `gem`.
- There are also CATEGORIES, which are indicated via an ***all-UPPERCASE*** directory name. Categories are for files that may be used in many different types of project, but remain consistent in usage or nature, such as those for projects using Git.


##### DISCLAIMER: These templates are based upon my own *HIGHLY* opinionated notions of software development and convention. They should *NOT* be taken as authoritative, or guaranteed to work as described above, considering the ever-changing state of software compatibility, specs, standards, etc outside of our control. Ideally this project will be kept up to date, but there is always the possibility that an included template or file might be rendered obsolete, invalid, or incompatible based on external changes (as is the case with most software).

###### To ensure all files and templates are valid and up to date, I validate them against current official information from time to time. The sources from which I based each file from are documented, with time and date of their most recent validation, are found in [`COMPATIBILITY.md`](COMPATIBILITY.md).
