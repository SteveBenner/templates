# Converters

### Workflowy
Lists exported from [Workflowy][] in 'Plain Text' format cannot be properly re-imported by pasting back into the app, if they contain any notes. The template `workflowy-ompl.slim` can be used to convert a list in 'Plain Text' format to OPML, which ***can*** be imported this way.
